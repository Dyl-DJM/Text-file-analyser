# Text-file-analyser
An analyser of text files. This project uses a lexicographic tree to store the words of the file. It allows to display the words, check if a word is written in the file, and save it in a .DIC/.L file.

## Optimizations

This project was done alone instead of been worked in a two devs team. I plan to quickly refactor the whole structure, to make it easier to use. (Using a makefile, making the user pdf more understandable, correcting the syntax errors on the pdf....)
